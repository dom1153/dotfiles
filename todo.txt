Planned:
- Readme instructions for brewfiles
- Justfile
- Add chezmoi zellij layout (and usage readme)
- zellij
	- allow alt + arrows to jump to panes
- Refactor fish config
	- Add $EDITOR (only if helix exists)
	- config.d usage?
- Refactor navi cheats
	- core.cheat
	- random.cheat
	- unix.cheat
- justfile
	- ### todo: gc (plus fish alias)
	- degit variant
	- setup (dist files / prompts -- gum?)
	- a way to check if config is out of data (e.g. verify version of setup)
	- brew config
		- + layout maybe
		- compare current /tmp/Brewfile to existing (difft)
- brew gum
- maintenence: check that brew bundle is out of sync (or command)
- more dotfile cleanup
	- neofetch
	- tealdeer
	- zellij
- local fish env override
- fisher setup
	- fish_config theme save "Catppuccin Mocha"
- cleanup `files` / dist folder

Add Development header to readme
All dotfiles should include a doc reference
If a local file can be provided, put it in files/dist with a version label (and be called .dist)
Chezmoi template files should have a ### === warning header
Prefer minimal config files, and reference full config elsewhere
Comment conventions
- #? for doc related comments
- ### for headers
- ## for subheaders
- # inline comments

Wants / Needs research:
- Add linter to require .tmpl files to have a mandatory comment explaining that they're a template file
- have a way to verify unix.cheat commands work as expected on macos and standard linux
- a way to cron maintenance tasks: e.g. tldr --update, brew update
- A proper chezmoi editing flow
- lazygit: control how 'open' command works?
- yazi follow symlinks? (e.g. ignore chezmoi add --template issues with _fav directory)
	- alt: use just command
- a testing system to make sure light mode config works
- as well as helix config?
- would be nice to have a starship signal if chezmoi is out of date
