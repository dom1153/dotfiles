Planned:
- Readme instructions for brewfiles
- Justfile
- Add chezmoi zellij layout (and usage readme)
- zellij
	- allow alt + arrows to jump to panes
	- default layout (remove staggared, default center though)
- Refactor fish config
	- Add $EDITOR (only if helix exists)
	- config.d usage?
- Refactor navi cheats
	- core.cheat
	- random.cheat
	- unix.cheat
	- new cheats
		- fish functions -> cdf
- justfile
	- ### todo: gc (plus fish alias)
	- degit variant
	- setup (dist files / prompts -- gum?)
	- a way to check if config is out of data (e.g. verify version of setup)
	- brew config
		- + layout maybe
		- compare current /tmp/Brewfile to existing (difft)
- brew gum
- maintenence: check that brew bundle is out of sync (or command)
- more dotfile cleanup
	- neofetch
	- tealdeer
	- zellij
- local fish env override
- fisher setup
	- fish_config theme save "Catppuccin Mocha"
- cleanup `files` / dist folder
- gnu stow local dotfile system (unmanaged, e.g. ssh, bashrc, zshrc)
- import old executable_scripts as justfiles (scripts module)
- templates module using chezmoi templates, just, and execute-template redirection (or navi)
- fzf inline search filenames (e.g. for adding arguments) (ctrl-f)
- refactor wezterm config
- navi template for linux only
- navi template for macos only
- fish keymaps
- check that fish brew path works on linux
- simple tmux config (catppucin)
- zellij auto-integration? (esp over ssh)
- cleanup fish 'features' documentation / shell integration
	- use ... | source , then override keybinds later
- catppuccin atuin
- document COLORTERM true color mode -> does it only need to be over ssh?
- nicities:
	- setup zellij / lack of nerdfont support for basic tty modes -> navi cheat with config override
	- ~~perhaps this could be a simple_fonts chezmoi value~~ (no such mode exits)
- setup brewfile refresh time

Add Development header to readme
All dotfiles should include a doc reference
If a local file can be provided, put it in files/dist with a version label (and be called .dist)
Chezmoi template files should have a ### === warning header
Prefer minimal config files, and reference full config elsewhere
Comment conventions
- #? for doc related comments
- ### for headers
- ## for subheaders
- # inline comments

Wants / Needs research:
- Add linter to require .tmpl files to have a mandatory comment explaining that they're a template file
- have a way to verify unix.cheat commands work as expected on macos and standard linux
- a way to cron maintenance tasks: e.g. tldr --update, brew update
- A proper chezmoi editing flow
- lazygit: control how 'open' command works?
- yazi follow symlinks? (e.g. ignore chezmoi add --template issues with _fav directory)
	- alt: use just command
- a testing system to make sure light mode config works
- as well as helix config?
- would be nice to have a starship signal if chezmoi is out of date
- using 'gum' to create interactive prompt scripts for things such as deleting unmanaged chezmoi files (or with fzf --preview 'cmd {}'
- use a chezmoi hook to append a comment on every chezmoi file (THIS IS A CHEZMOI FILE EDIT WITH ...)
- best way to make a cli clipboard command between macos and linux (pipe to 'copy')
	- test zellij flows
	- test ssh flows (with zellij)
- tealdeer hook? -> probably autoupdate flag
